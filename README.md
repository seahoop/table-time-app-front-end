## Project Description 

The Table-Time-App is a MERN stack application designed to simplify the process of booking a reservation at a resaurant for either just the customer, or with loved ones. A completed version of this app will allow restaurant owners to sign up and post available reservation times and dates on the app, while allowing customers to sign up and book these reservations. With this app, we hope to minimize the process of booking reservations while giving the user the option to favorite a specific restaurant they liked for even easier access.
